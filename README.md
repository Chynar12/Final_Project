# Final_Project

I built a vocabulary flash card app that will enable language learners to build their vocabulary set and practice at any time. The vocabulary app has an add function, a display function to display words in the set one by one, a practice function that shows the definition of the word and user types the word, a method to track how many words learned, a function that randomly makes a crossword using the words in the set, and a function to send a reminder to practice at a certain time.
